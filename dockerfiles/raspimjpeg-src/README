raspimjpeg
==========

This is a copy taken from silvanmelchior userland library
https://github.com/silvanmelchior/userland/tree/master/host_applications/linux/apps/raspicam

This is the raspimjpeg app only.

Run:
./raspimjpeg --config [path] [-v]

You will need:
- fairly new rpi/userland (Oct 2014)
- might also need to setup FIFO and folders:

mkdir -p /var/www/media
mkdir -p /dev/shm/mjpeg
mknod /var/www/FIFO p
chmod 666 /var/www/FIFO
